   # Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
DriverPass is an app/website which helps new drivers study for their upcoming drivers tests by allowing for students to purchase driving packages, schedule driving appointments, as well as review the requirements set by the DMV.
   # What did you do particularly well?
I believe that I created really good and comprehensive UML diagrams for this project. Some diagrams could be much better, but over all I think that the idea I was trying to portray was depicted properly.
   # If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would revise parts of my UML diagrams in the first project, as I didnt fully understand how a UML diagram worked in depth.
   # How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I had to look at the user's needs from a user's perspective, not from a designer's point of view. This helped me understand why the user would need a certain feature, and how the users should interact with the UI. Understanding the wants and needs of the user when designing a software would mean that the software you are creating completely matches up with the user's outlook.
   # How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
When designing software, I usually think of the long-term usage of the program and how it would be maintained. I usually create a list of potential setbacks on the creation process of the software, and attempt to prevent any errors from taking place. In the future, I would want to create a Gantt chart to lay out the general schedule of creating the software.
